# Predict the customer cancellation rate for a telecoms operator
## Project description
The main goal of this project is to build a prototype of a machine learning model for a telecoms operator. This operator provides mainly two types of services: communication by landline and internet.
The model must predict the customer cancellation rate. If the company finds out that a client is going to leave, they can offer promotional codes and special plan options.
## Goal
Create a machine learning model to predict the customer cancellation rate for a telecoms operator.
